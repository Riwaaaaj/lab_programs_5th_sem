## Environment and Tools

MATLAB has been chosen to run within Visual Studio Code due to the availability of the GitHub Copilot extension, which provided AI-assisted code suggestions based on prompts. This setup allows for a more flexible and assisted coding experience.

However, a possible switch back to the standalone MATLAB application can be considered, as it offers a built-in debugger that enhances the testing and troubleshooting process.

Reminder for the future:
The `whos` command can be used in the VS Code terminal to display all the variables that had been generated and were currently held in memory.
